# Task 4 - Logistic Regression

This project is part of my AI/ML internship.

I used the breast cancer dataset (`data.csv`) to build a binary classification model using logistic regression.

Steps I followed:
- Loaded and cleaned the data
- Converted diagnosis (M = 1, B = 0)
- Split the data into training and testing sets
- Standardized the features
- Trained the model
- Evaluated using confusion matrix, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC
- Plotted the ROC curve
- Tuned the threshold
- Explained the sigmoid function

All work is done in the Colab notebook.
